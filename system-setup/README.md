# CSCI 3411 - Operating Systems - System Setup

In past years, this course has adopted a relatively [laissez-faire](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/laissez-faire) approach to individual student setups. We provided rough requirements, a few suggestions, and some particularly virtuous students volunteered to produce resources and help their peers get systems online.

You can still do whatever you want, so long as you're building your code on Ubuntu 20 LTS for x86-64. That means you might need to emulate that architecture.

What's required:

-   Running Ubuntu 20 LTS operating system (in a VM is fine). 
    All homeworks will be _graded_ in this environment, so if you do your homeworks in any other environment, it is likely that you'll get compiler errors.
-   OPTIONALLY: you can run VS Code for your development.

    _Note: students natively running Ubuntu 20 LTS as their host operating system do not require virtualization_

## Setup Instructions

These might help, but might also be outdated.

-   [Windows](windows.md)
-   [Mac and Linux](multipass.md)

## Feedback Welcome

Given that this is new terrain for the instructional team, as you setup and use this environment, please keep notes on anywhere you struggled and consider making pull requests with fixes or improvements.
